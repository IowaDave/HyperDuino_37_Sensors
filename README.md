# HyperDuino_37_Sensors
Code examples for Roger Wagner's Hyperduino and the 37 Sensors kit 2.0 by Elegoo

The code examples support github gist files for inclusion in articles published on Instructables. 

Note dated September 2019: Shortly after completing the articles in mid-2018 I shifted my efforts to concentrate on the BBC micro:bit and Roger Wagner's MakerBit rather than the arduino.
